# Human-Activity-Recognition
The objective of this case study is to build a model that predicts human activities such as Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Standing, Sitting or laying using sensors like accelerometer to measures acceleration and gyroscope to measure angular velocity that we have in the Smartphone.

### Dataset Description
The dataset is collected from 30 persons performing different activities with a smartphone to their waist and it is recorded from the tri-axial reading of the accelerometer and gyroscope measured w.r.t time. So, we have 6 time series data as a input to solve a 6-class multi class classification problem.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).

### Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Data Analysis
- No. of data points per Activity
